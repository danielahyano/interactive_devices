## Overview:
This github directory contains the source code used for creative an Interactive Device.  
There are two parts of the code. The first one is written in C++ and you need to load the code to the arduino. This code is located at the bottom
of the 


C++ and was transferred to the ESP32 TTGO T-display from the laptop, using the Arduino IDE and a type C cable.


## Hardware:
- LilyGo ESP32 TTGO T-Display

- Joystick


- Button

- Cables

## Set up 

The Arduino IDE can be downloaded in (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). 

After downloading the Arduino IDE, you can follow the instructions in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adLUgmCJKnM (a video made by our professor) to do the setup. 

If you are on a MacBook, you may need to install: https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-T-Call-SIM800/issues/139#issuecomment-90439071. 

After this, you can get the code from generative_art.ino and transfer it to the ESP32 using a type C cable connected from the notebook to the device (pressing the '->' in the top left of the screen.
